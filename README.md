* search for breeds of animal by enter animal type(e.g. 'dog')
* search for all animals of the specified breed and location(e.g.'German Shepherd Dog' & 'San Francisco CA')
* the search results show the animal name, breed, age, sex, etc., along with the contact information for adoption
* add animals to his/her list of interest
* add comments for each animal
* dog is the only animal type supported in this first release
